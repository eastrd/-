- 16 regions in the world, 44 availability zones (Dec 2017)
- 6 more regions & 17 more availability zones (2018)

- Region: Geographical area (e.g. Sydney, London). Each region consists of 2 or more AZ (availability zones).
- AZ: Simply data centers each with redundant power, networking and connectivity. Two AZ can be in the same region, but they are far apart in the case of disasters so the data can be protected.
- Edge Locations: Endpoints for AWS used for caching contents. (consists CloudFront, AWS CDNs). More edge locations (currently 96) than regions.
